This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been initialized.  This is common in React Native components that have asynchronous operations, like fetching data from an API or waiting for a navigation action to complete.

```javascript
// Buggy component
function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(setData);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* Error: Can't read properties of undefined (reading 'name') */}
    </View>
  );
}
```
