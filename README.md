# React Native Uninitialized State Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable before it has been properly initialized after an asynchronous operation. The error occurs because the component tries to render before the data fetching is complete.

## The Problem
The `MyComponent` fetches data from an API.  However, it immediately tries to render `data.name`, which will be `undefined` until the `fetch` promise resolves. This causes a `TypeError`.

## Solution
The solution involves conditional rendering to check if `data` is available before rendering the `Text` component.  This ensures that the app won't crash while waiting for data.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using a React Native simulator or device.  You should see the error in the console.
4. Check the `bugSolution.js` file for a corrected version.
